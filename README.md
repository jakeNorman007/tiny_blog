# TinyBlog

- Version 1.0.0
- TinyBlog is exactly what it says it is. A tiny blog.
- TinyBlog is built to be lightweight and simplistic in architecture. The beginning of TinyBlog started as a portfolio project, although it still is, it evolved into a type of philosophy as well. That philosophy is to keep code short, simple and concise. Most importantly however TinyBlog serves the purpose of a fully functional blogging platform while attempting to optimize the process behind the scenes.

- Sometimes less is more.
- Our main purpose is to make simple things for simple people.

- Built with [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
- Styled with [Pico css](https://picocss.com/)
